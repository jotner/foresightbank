# Foresight Bank
Foresight Bank is a project by four then-students at IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg, Sweden; André Ingman, Johan Westin, Jonathan Eriksson & Victor Olsson. 
The project was created during an assignment for one of IT-Högskolans web development courses in 2019.

----

This is a fullstack project built with Node JS, Express, Vue, HTML and CSS.
Foresight Bank is a fictional bank in which the client can register as a user, handle funds and transfer funds to other registered users. As it's not a real bank, you as a user will get a random amount of money in your main account upon registration, which the user then can transfer to other users or move between the users own accounts.
The user can also change his or her username or password or delete the account together with the all the funds.

If you want to try out the project, clone the repository, install all dependencies in both /frontend and /backend and then start the project in /frontend with 'npm start'.
